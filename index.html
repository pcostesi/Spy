      Compiler and VM for the S Language
    </div>

    <p>S bytecode has been designed with portability and ease of implementation
even in low-level languages. It is a big-endian binary file that stores
both the program and optionally a snapshot.
Layout

Metadata Instructions
S bytecode is big-endian and has the following layout:
* A Header _non-padded_ struct with:
- A 4-byte unsigned integer containing the Magic
- A 2-byte unsigned short major version
- A 2-byte unsigned short
* An Info _non-padded_ struct with:
- Number of instructions in DATA section (for serialized data)
as a 4-byte unsigned integer.
- Number of instructions in EXEC section (the actual program)
as a 4-byte unsigned integer.
* An _OPTIONAL_ DATA section of _non-padded_ structs with:
- VAR instructions
- *ONE* terminal JMP instruction.
* An _OPTIONAL_ EXEC section of _non-padded_ structs with:
- An unsigned char opcode
- A 2-byte signed short representing the variable:
. Positive for X
. 0 for y
. Negative for Z
- A 2-byte unsigned short with payload data:
For JNZ: an absolute index for the next instruction
* An optional EXTRA section. No special requirements are made
regarding this section, except that it must be big-endian and
safefly ignored by virtual machines.
Metadata Section
----------------
"Magic" (MAGI) is an arbitrary integer that identifies S bytecode. It
also prevents unsafe handling of strings in C code, as the first bytes
will serve as NUL terminators.
Major (MA) and Minor (MI) version numbers identify the bytecode version.
As a norm, changes that break existing instruction semantics increment
the major version number, while new instructions that can be safely
ignored (such as debugging instructions, VM signaling, NOP) or EXTRA
sections added at the end of the file.
The INFO section contains the length of the DATA and EXEC sections. This
allows linear parsers to allocate memory and set logic boundaries between
DATA, EXEC and EXTRA.
Instructions Section
--------------------
The DATA and EXEC sections are technically a single section containing
bytecode opcodes and parameters. However, both sections have different
purposes:
* The DATA section contains the state of a running program, and
it comes before the EXEC section so a linear VM can pre-load
(and jump to the appropiate instruction) before running the
program. This section can be of zero size.
The recommended layout of this section is to place only VAR
instructions and a final JMP instruction, although it is possible
to use any instruction here (so using any instruction other than
VAR and JMP in this section are undefined behaviour).
* The EXEC section contains the program itself. Any instruction
may be used here, although it is strongly discouraged to use VAR
and JMP instructions (as those are not part of the S Language
itself and alter the behaviour of the program, and are left as
undefined behaviour).
Ancillary Section
-----------------
Finally, the EXTRA section is not mandatory and may contain any data.
The purpose of this section is to add information about the program such
as original source code, author and even another program. This section
runs for the rest of the length of the file. The only two restrictions
are that it must be big-endian and must be safely ignored.
Instructions
============
Instructions are comprised by an opcode and two parameters (the first
usually the variable, the second a positive value).
Variables
---------
Variables are signed short integers:
. Positive for X
. 0 for y
. Negative for Z
There's no need for complex bit twiddling to get the index for Z. It is
just the negative index (in two's complement).
Instruction Table
-----------------
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| Instruction | Word | Opcode | Parameter | Value | Virtual |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| No operation | NOP | 0 | -- | -- | Yes |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| Increment | INC | 1 | Variable | 0 to 65535 | No |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| Decrement | DEC | 2 | Variable | 0 to 65535 | No |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| Jump if var | JNZ | 3 | Variable | 0 to 65535 | No |
| is non-zero | | | | 0 means exit | |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| | TAG | 4 | a = 1 | 0 to 65535 | |
| Tag | | | ... | 0 empty idx | Yes |
| | | | e = 5 | Tag index | |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| Set variable | VAR | 5 | Variable | 0 to 65535 | No |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+
| Jump | JMP | 6 | -- | 0 to 65535 | No |
+--------------+------+--------+-----------+--------------+---------+

Both jumps use absolute addressing, starting at the beginning of the
EXEC section.
